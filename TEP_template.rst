 TEP Template
==============


This TEP template is a guideline of the sections that a TEP should
contain.  Extra sections may be added if appropriate, and unnecessary
sections may be noted as such.

The TEP should start with a title:

TEPXXX: Meaningful title
========================

Status
======

TEPs go through a number of phases in their lifetime:

- **Discussion**: The TEP is being actively discussed and is
  being improved by its author.  The mailing list
  discussion of the TEP should include the TEP number (TEPxxx) in the
  subject line so they can be easily related to the TEP.

- **Progress**: Consensus was reached on the mailing list and
  implementation work has begun.

- **Completed**: The implementation has been merged into master.

- **Superseded**: This TEP has been abandoned in favor of another
  approach.

Responsible

Branches and Pull requests
==========================

All development branches containing work on this TEP should be linked to from here.

All pull requests submitted relating to this TEP should be linked to
from here.  (A TEP does not need to be implemented in a single pull
request if it makes sense to implement it in discrete phases).

Abstract
========

The abstract should be a short description of what the TEP will achieve.

Detailed description
====================

This section describes the need for the TEP.  It should describe the
existing problem that it is trying to solve and why this TEP makes the
situation better.  It should include examples of how the new
functionality would be used and perhaps some use cases.

Implementation
==============

This section lists the major steps required to implement the TEP.
Where possible, it should be noted where one step is dependent on
another, and which steps may be optionally omitted.  Where it makes
sense, each step should include a link related pull requests as the
implementation progresses.

Backward compatibility
======================

This section describes the ways in which the TEP breaks backward incompatibility.

Alternatives
============

If there were any alternative solutions to solving the same problem,
they should be discussed here, along with a justification for the
chosen approach.
